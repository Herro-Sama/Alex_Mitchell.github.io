Nebula Knights is a student project created in Unreal Engine 4. It is a 1-4 person couch Co-op game featuring hack and slash gameplay elements. During this project I spent time working primarily on the UI elements and making sure they were functional.

### Hyper Heatwave Runner

During the 2017 Global Game Jam I took part working with a small team to develop an endless runner style game. This game was made in Unity and was one of my first project made within Unity.
